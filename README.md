# Sol
An Kotlin library for science and math in the real world.

The core logic behind [Trail Sense](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense). This is intended for my use only at this point, so there isn't any documentation on it. 

## Installation (Gradle)
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.kylecorry31:sol:<version>'
}
```
